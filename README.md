#### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that what I develop is functional and secure, I will utilize best practices in all of my work. Developing a robust testing strategy that includes unit, integration, and system testing will ensure that the system is fully functional and secure. I will complete this utilizing automated testing frameworks and tools to thoroughly validate code for correctness. By following secure coding practices, I will minimize the risk of security breaches, including practices such as input validation, authentication and authorization, and other security practices.

#### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
By ensuring I am completing requirements gathering, analyzing those requirements, defining them, and then executing upon them, I will ensure that I am incorporating them correctly into the program. Developing test cases based on those requirements will ensure that the system is successfully executing to those requirements and ensuring that the end produce is validated accordingly.

#### How do I approach designing software?
When approaching a design project, I first start with the requirements of that system. Once the requirements have been identified, I utilized them to plan the build, developing the system on paper first to ensure it is designed utilizing best practices. Once it has been put to paper, I will develop the individual units, building test cases to validate that they function accuratly. Once built, I test the system through integration and system testing to ensure a fully functional system that performs as expected and to spec.
